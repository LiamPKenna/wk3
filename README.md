# _Beep Boop: Arrays & Looping_

#### _Web application that loops, November 1st 2019_

#### By _**Liam Kenna**_

## Description

_This site is a simple web application that takes a users name and a number, then returns all numbers from 0 to their input. Any numbers including 1, 2, or 3 will be replaced by the following logic:_

* _Any number containing the digit 3 will be replaced with "I'm sorry, {USER NAME}. I'm afraid I can't do that."_
* _Any number containing 2 but not 3 will be replaced with "Boop!"_
* _Any number containing 1 but not 2 or 3 will be replaced with "Beep!"_

_For example:_

| Input:  | Output:   |
|---|---|
|"4"| 0 - Beep! - Boop! - I'm sorry... - 4 |
|"5"| 0 - Beep! - Boop! - I'm sorry... - 4 - 5 |

_Bonus content will also be shown based on coin-flip logic that either uses random number generation or decides based on if the number input is divisible by 2, 3, or 5. This same logic also updates the background color of the page_

_Possible bonus representations of the user's number:_

* _As binary_
* _As its computed factorial_
* _As a random math result (Square Root / Cubed Root / Cubed / Cosine)_
* _With digits reversed_
